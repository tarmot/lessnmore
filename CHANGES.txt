- Users logging in over HTTPS will be authenticated with a cookie that will not leak out over HTTPS

- Cookies are now set with HTTP_ONLY, which means rogue JavaScript cannot steal your authentication cookie

- There is now a LOG OUT button

	the current protocol your server is responding to, by default.
	You can manually specify your preferred protocol in `config.php`.
